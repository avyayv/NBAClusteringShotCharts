Please look at ClusterAndPlot.ipynb for code/text on the clustering algorithm. You can edit the players and see which players are in which clusters over time. 

To get data (you can edit and play around with data), you can edit GetData.ipynb. Here, you can scrape the latest data and edit from there.

Some basic explanations of my methods can be found on my blog posts at https://analyzeball.com/2019/12/24/clustering-nba-shot-charts-part-2/.

The model is stored in the .pkl file. You can use the model using the code present in the notebook.
